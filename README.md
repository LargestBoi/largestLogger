# Issues/suggestions
Please make a GitHub issue with your problem and the steps to replicate it. I will then look into it with
my own time and attempt to resolve it. If you have a suggestion just make an issue with your suggested change,
or better yet implement the change on a fork and do a pull request, I will review the code, the changes you
are to make and I will either merge to main to rewrite the feature myself into the main branch!
